# Scale and Rotational Invariant Scaling

This Read-Me file contains the project description and the description of the code provided as solution to this problem, as well as the reasoning behind it. I will also use this file for Backlogging, including my breakdown of the tasks, estimated time and completion time. This will have the added benefit of learning to accurately estimate the time requried for different tasks/subtasks, an important skill needed for improving self efficiency in managing projects.
